## Features

  - Integers and floats
  - Simple but full-featured API
  - Replicates many of the methods of JavaScript's `Number.prototype` and `Math` objects
  - Also handles hexadecimal, binary and octal values
  - Faster, smaller, and perhaps easier to use than JavaScript versions of Java's BigDecimal
  - No dependencies
  - Wide platform compatibility: uses JavaScript 1.5 (ECMAScript 3) features only
  - Comprehensive [documentation](https://mikemcl.github.io/decimal.js/) and test set
  - Used under the hood by [math.js](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs)
  - Includes a TypeScript declaration file: *decimal.d.ts*

![API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MikeMcl/decimal.js/gh-pages/API.png)

The library is similar to [bignumber.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js/), but here
precision is specified in terms of significant digits rather than decimal places, and all
calculations are rounded to the precision (similar to Python's decimal module) rather than just
those involving division.

This library also adds the trigonometric functions, among others, and supports non-integer powers,
which makes it a significantly larger library than *bignumber.js* and the even smaller
[big.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/big.js/).

For a lighter version of this library without the trigonometric functions see
